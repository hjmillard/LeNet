# LeNet
Modified LeNet using DropOut, ReLU and Max Pooling Layers.

To run the code, run the following command:
    python classifier.py

This will begin training the model, after which, the user will be prompted to enter an image to predict.
The image must be 32x32 pixels and should contain a number (0-9).
