classifier.py is a Neural Network implemented using the Pytorch framework. It learns from the MNIST10 dataset, which should be saved in the same directory as the program.

To run the program enter: python classifier.py

The program will begin running and will prompt the user for images after having completed training.

You can then enter the path to the image to predict the number in an image or 'exit' to terminate the program.
